"Gambling and betting are probably as old as mankind. Once sports events "

"already pretty popular in the late XIX century, but it was only in the "
"1920's that the first football pool"

"Each week, when a collector called to pick-up the completed pools coupons "
"along with the appropriate amount of money necessary to play, a fresh set of "

"go to a betting post to fill these forms. They had a list of some of the "
"week matches. The filled form was then posted to the pools firm, with a "
"postal order or cheque for the sum staked (or &ldquo;invested&rdquo;, as the "
"firms used to say). At the end of the weekend the results of the matches "

"The first football pools company was Littlewoods, created by John Moores, "
"Colin Askham and Bill Hughes in 1923. The concept of the classic pools was "
"an instant hit with the public and it flourished until the start of the war "
"in 1939. In 1946 normal service was resumed as the football league started "
"up again. Fortunately for people wanting to try their luck (or skill), "
"football pools were not outlawed or put out of business and they kept "
"growing. It did not take long before competing companies were formed. "
"Vernons Pools came on the scene in 1925, and in 1933, Zetters Pools became "
"the third company to offer their services to players. In 1945, George "
"Britten started his family football pool firm, Brittens Pools"

"Starting in 1935, the &ldquo;penny points&rdquo; bet was the most popular "

"&ldquo;2&rdquo; or an &ldquo;x&rdquo; to show that he thought the result of "
"the match would be a home win, a visitor win or a draw, respectively. Home "
"wins guessed correctly received 1 point, visitors wins received 2 points and "
"draws received 3. The bet with highest scores won money prizes. After the "
"war, the Treble chance became more popular. In this system, the bettor had "

"In Brazil, especially during WC's, contests where people try to predict the "
"final score of each match (i.e. the number of goals scored by each team) are "
"very popular. Here, we do not want that. We want you to think "
"probabilistically. Think about your probability as some amount, like 100 kg "
"or pounds of something or $100 of some currency. You must decide on how to "
"divide this amount in three baskets: in one basket you'll put the amount "
"corresponding to your confidence on the victory of team A; in the following "
"basket the amount corresponding to your confidence on a draw; and in the "
"third basket the amount corresponding to your confidence on the victory of "
"team B. Notice that you have a fixed amount, so your probabilities should "
"add up to 100."

"a lot better than -3.47 because his prevision was closer to the observed "

"evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts and rewards good forecasts "
"while punishing those that overshoot. (We’ve adapted the system for our game "
"essentially by rescaling the scores; the result is that players in our game "
"can earn between -50 and +25 points). In the example above, if Spain had "
"won, you'd score 8.5 and your friend, -16.9 because in this case your "
